# Server-Template
A template of a Fabric server including the mods
and data packs used on the Salty Spittoon.

Run.bat will start the Fabric server with 10GB
of allocated RAM by default unless the values
in RUN.bat are changed. 

Match the ports in server.properties and
config\Geyser-Fabric\config.yml to the port you wish
to use. Default is 25565.

To disable cross-platform play, remove
Floodgate-Fabric-X.X.X.jar and
geyser-fabric-X.X.X.jar from the
mods folder.
